Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun

No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down

Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee

In here I spend everyday in captivity
Devoured while the walls grow hands and teeth
I cried and listened to the rain in a rental car
One day somebody's gonna go and get pushed too far
But now I don't know what to say
Shall I deny my lungs their breathing rights?

So give it up, give it up
Don't let your mind slip away

Saluda al sol una mañana más
Hay un silencio en su cabeza
Que la levantó a pensar
Frente al espejo susurrando
""Ya no quiero más""
Decidí volar sin ti, disfrutar mi soledad
Que hoy no te quiero más, no
Estoy cansada de escuchar que cambiarás
Tu hipocresía no me va
Yo ya no te espero

Ella se fue y no volverá jamás
En el reflejo se puso a bailar
Sobreviviendo su realidad
Dejó pagada la cuenta ya
No necesita nadie para amar
Porquе ya nadie la controla más
Sin esa sombra solo brillará
Y jamás se volvеrá a callar

To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

[Post-Chorus]
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short

Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)

Nostalgia, what a funny feelin'
I feel depleted from feelings I've been revealin'
It's do or die, I'm not goin' willing
But when it's time, wrap in white linen
I rap this, I say it for my sanity
Whatever the calamity, I did this for myself
Fuck all of your fantasies
You're a snake, fell off the ladder
I prefer speakin' in analogies
I've had enough of all this wet
And I can't trust that you're my family
I don't know what's next
The brain dead that I never miss
My brain lives with the cannabis
Can I resist the dark abyss?
Leave a mark on this with no start, just exist
My mind's in a prism shape
And in timеs like a prison state
Therе's no right that I feel of late
There's no light if my view's at stake
And which life should I choose to take?
What's left, is it room or space?
There are rumors we have to face
I prefer sooner than after late
I seen actors after BAFTA's be more straight
I mean down the barrel
I hear 'em sing, it's the same carol
They're tryna sprint in a long run, Mo Farah
They're tryna fix when it's long gone, don't bother
There's no other, the thought shudders through most lovers
I wanna bed you, but still 
sleep is death's cousin
So two weeks is now four dozen
Years that pass by, can't press no rewind
Just watch my life by and lock the right ties

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

Show me the places where the others gave you scars

Oh my, I remember those nights
Meet you at your uni', cheap drinks, drink ’em all night
Staying out 'til sunrise
Share a single bed and tell each other what we dream about
Things we'd never say to someone else out loud
We were only kids, just tryna work it out
Wonder what they'd think if they could see us now, yeah

'Cause we made it
Underestimated
And always underrated
Now we're saying goodbye (Goodbye)
Waving to the hard times
Knew that we would be alright

Looking into your eyes
Baby, you were still high
Never coming down with your hand in mine

[Verse 2]
Oh, God, what I could've become
Don't know why they put all of this on us when we’re so young
Done a pretty good job dealing with it all
When you’re here, don't need to say no more
Nothing in the world that I would change it for
Singing something pop-y on the same four chords
Used to worry ’bout it, but I don't no more, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause we made it
Underestimated
And always underrated
Now we're saying goodbye (Goodbye)
Waving to the hard times
Smoke something, drink something

Never coming down with your hand in mine

Hey !
Pour les trois prochaines minutes, j'veux qu'on m'appelle : Jimmy Punchline !

[Couplet unique]
C'est l'retour de la légende de Jimmy
Même si j'peux craquer à tout moment, comme les jambes de Djibril [cric]
2008 j'lance le missile
Si t'écoutais pas d'rap en 98, change de vinyle
Parce que j'kicke la prod à l'ancienne, nique la mode
J'viens kicker, comme quand j'kickais pour démarrer ma Vogue
Cherche pas d'messages dans mes phases, dans mes métaphores
J'fais ça pour le plaisir, parce que j'trouve que j'déchire
Oh ! J'représente le ""7""
J'écris des textes tirés par les cheveux comme ta meuf en levrette
J'crache le feu sur ta bande de traîtres
C'est le remake de Sodome et Gomorrhe, un holocauste sonore
J'suis trop gore pour le grand public
T'façon j'm'en branle des Victoires de la Musique : j'vise les Hot d'Or
Tous les jours, j'me couche aux aurores
Et j'pars au taf avec une gueule d'enterrement comme si j'étais croque-mort
J'suis les Beatles pour les jeunes ados
J'pourrais passer sur Sky, même si mon single s'appelait ""Fun Radio""
J'crache dans tes règles, ça fait ketchup-mayo
J'te baise sur un tas d'bois, t'attrapes une syphilis de derrière les fagots
J'distribuais des CD dans l'Hexagone
Pendant qu'tu distribuais tes CV dans les Mac-Do
Alors j'comprends qu'tu voudrais faire un feat
Mais moi j'voudrais un Big Mac et une grande frite
Et ça fait ""1 pour mon estomac"",
 
""2 pour ma bite""
Basse-Normandie, 14000, tu sais où j'habite
Jimmy-Jimmy-Jimmy vient t'ôter la vie
J't'envoie en chimi-chimio-chimiothérapie
Oui c'est gratuit, j'suis bête et méchant
Si j'dois mettre des gants, j't'arrache la jugulaire avec les dents
Et quand on fait la fête chez tes parents, ça part en tapage nocturne
On fait tourner l'cul d'la vieille alors que personne fume
Laisse-moi prendre ma respiration
J'devrais être sponso MSN : tout l'monde prend mes citations
Trouve-moi en pleine méditation dans un débit d'boissons
Ma gueule de bois ferait passer Pinocchio pour un vrai p'tit garçon
J'écris des tubes à l'encre de banane
 
(What else?)
J'te refile des trucs via l'antre de ta femme
T'arrives à rapper super vite : pas mal
Mais si t'as du flow et pas d'paroles, tu seras jamais plus fort que Scatman
T'aurais dû arrêter l'rap au lieu d'arrêter l'école
T'aurais dû lâcher la musique au lieu d'lâcher des coms
J'ai un truc énorme entre les jambes comme un contrebassiste
Aussi vrai qu't'es pas Français si t'as pas un oncle raciste
J'débarque comme un tsunami
Tu vois défiler-défiler-défiler toute ta vie
Oo-de-lally,
 
j'te fais passer sous l'baby
Ton équipe fait pitié comme un orphelinat en Roumanie
J'rappe sous tipunch,
 
et les ladies bougent leur punany
Arrêtez d'mouiller, j'ai l'impression d'baiser sous la pluie
J'arrive tête de gondole, texte de Mongol
Tu-tu-tu-tu-tu bouges ta bête de coupe au bol
Avec ma p'tite copine, on s'pète la tête au gin
J'la baise complètement dead comme si j'étais nécrophile
J'la trompe que dans les autres villes, ça compte pas
Haltérophile sexuel : j'soulève des meufs qui font deux fois mon poids
J'traîne avec des futurs médecins et des ex-taulards
Skready Krueger à la prod', et j'suis ton pire cauchemar
Gringe et Skread, c'est Baudelaire et Mozart
Ablaye va t'refaire le portrait, et il a jamais fait les Beaux-Arts
J'vénère les femmes à tête de chiennes comme les Égyptiens
J'déteste les trav' depuis qu'j'ai failli ken un Brésilien
Continue d'rapper des 
mythos
, tu l'fais si bien
Tu parles de douilles et d'plombs, mais t'es électricien
Bref si t'as des couplets d'merde, bosse le refrain
Si c'est ça l'rap game, j'dois être le boss de fin
Si tu veux pomper ""Saint-Valentin"", commence par avoir des rapports
Puceau, t'as du mal à baiser ta propre main
Dans la nouvelle scène j'suis l'seul qui sort du lot
J'suis l'seul écrivain potable depuis Victor Hugo
J'marche sur l'eau, j'nage sur le bitume

"The Style Council","Handed down from fathers to sons
Was the hatred of weakness and the love of guns
A talk of peace but not in our time
To save our souls and stop the crime
Onwards and upwards but going nowhere
So how many now truthfully swear
That they do no evil, see no wrong
The ad-mass agents, the writers of song
The bankers, the poets, the modern day seers
Clouding an issue that was never quite clear
Sent through the ages of boy to man
The living testament of making a stand
Killing the wicked then raising the dead
Eating propaganda and shit spoon fed
Grasping for wisdom, but thick all the same
So how many innocents now can claim
That they play with fire and get burnt
And through the same mistakes never get learnt
Hoping for a time it will fall to place
Faith shall show as our saving grace

Like that y'all
Don't stop y'all
To the march y'all
To the top

Handed down from God with love
Was the whole wide world and some above
But not content to share the land
Greed was shown the winning hand
And those whose greed was the strongest of all
Took upon themselves to lead the call
That some must work while other rest
Without the question of what is best
The leaders, the losers and the kings
Pass the rifle butt that tyranny brings

That's right y'all
Take that y'all
Too much y'all
Don't stop

It's not a rat race
It's not a drag race
It's not an arms race
Cause that's a mad race
But if we're all part of the human race
Then why ain't this like a just race

Anybody everybody somebody anybody
Anybody in the house just help me

I said all right all right if you're sad and blue
And if you don't know just what to do
Then communication is the key
It's the gift that we're given free

Passed on over to the chosen few
Was the promise of freedom with a breadline queue
Ghetto's, gateaux and eating it too
Forcing it all down with a cola brew
The first amendment and the hunt for reds
A conscious contradiction with something said
That they see no evil with eyes shut tight
A cocaine culture that offers no fight
Dragged from birth, drugged to death
The common excuse is just being yourself

That's right y'all
Take that y'all
To the top y'all
Keep a-rockin'

Hand us down before it's too late
The strength and wisdom to change our state
Governed by evil and all it will bring
I can't wait for the day they do the lamppost swing
And no mercy should they be shown
For you cannot reason with the devil's own
They say, they hear no evil, hands clasped tight
To shut out the victims' screams of ol' Uncle Sam fights
He sweats and he strains as his boney frame comes

Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting

Maar ik heb geen affiniteit met een gast die m'n fallus en m'n ballen bereikt

Haal 'm eraf en verplaats 'm voor een spannende meid
En iedere spannende meid vraagt zich af 'zal ik het zijn'

"She Drew The Gun","I’m about to get upset from watching my TV
Checking out the news until my eyeballs fail to see
I mean to say that every day is just another rotten mess
When’s it gonna change, my friend, is anybody’s guess
So I’m watching and I’m waiting, hoping for the best
Think I’ll even go to praying every time I hear them saying that
There’s no way to delay that trouble coming every day
No way to delay that trouble coming every day

Wednesday watch the riot, seen the busies on the street
I watch them throwing rocks and stuff and choking in the heat
I listen to reports about the whiskey passing round
See the smoke and fire and the market burning down
Watched while everybody on the street would take a turn
To stomp and smash and crash and bash and slash and bust and burn

And I'm watching and I'm waiting, hoping for the best
Think I'll even go to praying every time I hear them saying
That there's no way to delay that trouble coming every day
No way to delay that trouble coming every day

Well you can cool it, you can heat it
'Cause, baby, I don't need it
Take your TV tube and eat it
All that phony stuff on sports
You know I watched that rotten box
Until my head began to hurt from checking out the way
That they don’t dig up the right dirt
And they’re selling out the people and further they assert
That they’re totally transparent not complicit and absurd
With their pantomime neutrality distorting every word
And they’re rising on the right ‘cause they’re appealing to the side
And they’re out to blame the poorest because he’s unsatisfied
With what the neoliberal program has left him for a life
Because the architects of policy have sold them a soundbite
No society just family so as long as I’m alright

So I'm watching and I'm waiting, hoping for the best
Think I'll go to praying every time I hear him saying
That there's no way to delay that trouble coming every day
No way to delay that trouble coming every day

And they’re rebelling our extinction, they’re making such a jam
To stopping cars in London just to stick it to the man
‘Cause we’ve gotta go cold turkey, gotta give up all our gas
Addicted to the fossil fuels but they ain’t gonna last
And the scene is getting hotter like the scientists foretell
And them cats up in the boardroom should be going straight to hell
The corporate institutions, the whole bloody cartel
Except the Holy Church of England has still got them shares in Shell
And they’re cutting all the funding ‘cause they’re stripping back the state
Privatised policing, advertising hate
And they’re selling us a ticket to something that don’t exist
And their cup that overflows is just filled up with hypocrites

So I'm watching and I'm waiting, hoping for the best
Think I'll even go to praying every time I hear them saying
That there's no way to delay that trouble coming every day

Can we fake the life you know I should have had
Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care
Or I'll have to give the part to someone else

And then you changed your character
And avoided all of your lines

Can you play his part at this time

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?

I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

I'll prolly die anonymous,
 
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

未だ見ない幸先へと
僕は只今あるき出したところ
至るまでの途上　超高層ビル
見上げすぎて首が痛いな

見ず知らずの他人同士だから
あなたと関わり合いたい
毎晩とる食事のようにただただ
変わることなく続くと思ってた

ぐるぐる貼られる口にガムテープ
ダブるフレーズ　トばす癖
僕はいつでも本当しか言えないし
とてもエゴイスティック

知ってるだろ

終わるには早すぎるから
荷物まとめて此処を出る
会いたい　期待したいまだ
ああ　僕の血を通ってる

泣いても変えられないとしても
それでも変えたいと願うのは
虚脱を壊す　今終わらす
薄志弱行な僕は

誰より誠実な味方はいつも
過去の自分と知ってるから
この身くたばる前に穿つ
怖いことなどない

また実らすため花ゆり落ちて
裏返るあの日の約束を果たそう
漂う煙草の煙に巻かれた
君の諦めすら蹴り上げる

何度殴られ罵られたって
君の言葉の掛目には満たない
ガソリンを撒け　さあ今すぐに
本能に跨っていけよ

引き返せないところまで来たみたい
諸行無常　愛すべき東京
見知らぬ昨日、人、思想、時代
乱雑無章　出会いたい表情
覆したい予想通りの先

たった一世紀無い命で
できること　守れるもの
あと幾つあるんだろう

泣いても変えられないとしても
それでも変えたいと願うなら
何が変わる？何か変わる？
手を下すのはいつも

誰でもない逃げられない
今此処にいる自分と知ってるから
この身くたばる前に繋ぐ

急行の田都で丸ノ内乗って
なんて身勝手な生活
君だってそうでしょう
手放しでハッピーエンド
何年使ってもなりきれない理想
不安定な明日を見越して
とりあえず今日をキスで凌ごう

先天性のズレ
およそ1.3億息づいた劣等感を
どうか抱きしめて終わりたい

ハイトーン　レスポール
ベッドに君が好き
また会える　巡り会える
そんな幸先なら

泣いても変えられないとしても
それでも変えたいと願うから

どうか

足掻いても伝わらないよそれでも
僕らには言葉しかないから

歌い続けるよ

泣いても変えられないとしても
それでも変えたいと願うのは
虚脱を壊す　今終わらす

Love is life and life is love,

Every part of you, the party life can never do enough
So many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up
Can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck
I'll play the prostitute if you've got the patience to pimp me
But you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
Put it on your fingertips and I'll kiss it off
You better not kiss me goodbye, Test my faith and kiss the cross
I'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's alright
Tell me that you care, baby, we could share a full life
Truth and double dare that I do repair broken hearts
Cupid shot me in the dark, stupid I didn't play my part
Ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it I can serve a purpose
If I'm st.. st.. stuttering because I'm nervous
Tell me that you love me still, promise that I'm staying still
Honesty is all I need, honestly, we can build

Opp get to trippin', we flippin' him like a mattress

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
""I love you, need you, need you here to stay""

Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' ""Finally Famous!"" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown

And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die

And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by

"The Hotelier","Open the curtains
Singing birds tell me
""Tear the buildings down.""
You felt blessed
To receive their pleasant sound
Of things that break
Make you cringe
Inside yourself there's a child
Counting stars in their time-out
Of their day
In the corners of their frame
They are encased
In the losing of a grain
Of themselves
Pushed against the ebb and flow
Wave good-bye and watch it go
Well show me the honest, proper way
To disarm predatory gaze
Sucking dry
Never satiated
You've been misused
Been rewired
You're short-circuiting now
Just remember when
You'd call me to come
Take a deep breath, and then jump
So fragile are bodies
So concave, work in
Self-destructive ways
Shot from the hip and missed
Detaching from all of this
In physical pictures you remain
Spiral 'round yourself in figure-eight
I recoil at every new beginning
I searched for a way out
Don't we all?
Existentialist recall:
Turn in all dichotomies and
Truths that I gave
I felt wrong in many ways
Didn't heal
Just got harder every day
To be still
To be passing
Through the throes
In a daze
Feeling heavy
Feeling cold in my skin
In my 
hand-me-downs
Wearing everything thin
And the pills
That you gave didn't do anything
I just slept for years on end
(Fuck!)

So if I call
Should I beg?
Because I'm desperate here;
A couple steps from the edge
I can't seem to burn bright enough

I know I said to not
What the fuck do I know?

And he only paused a moment

And I've been broken but I'm better everyday

Is there a right way for how this goes?
You've got your friends and you've got your foes
They want a piece of somethin' hot
Forget your name like they forgot
Oh, ain't that somethin'?

[Verse 2]
So when I see you crash and burn
I criticize your every word
I'm tryna keep from goin' insane
Ain't that the way of this whole damn thing?
Oh, tryin' to be something more

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this
Nobody's gonna hold your hand and guide you through
No, it's up for you to understand
Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done and it's time for you to walk away
So when you have today
You should say all that you have to say
Say all that you have to say

[Verse 3]
Is there a right way for bein' strong?
Feels like I'm doin' things all wrong
Still, I'm here just holdin' on
Confess my heart and forgive my wrongs
Oh, just tryna show you somethin' more

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this
Nobody's gonna hold your hand
And guide you through
It's up for you to understand
Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done
And it's time for you to walk away
When you have today
You should say all that you have to say

[Bridge]
Don't point the blame when you can't find nothin'
Look to yourself and you might find somethin'
It's time that we sorted out
All of the things we complain about
So listen close to the sound of your soul
Take back a life we led once before
If it ain't you, then who
If it ain't you, then who's gonna love you?
Oh

Nobody's going to love you if
You can't display a way to capture this
Nobody's going to hold your hand and guide you through

[Verse 1]
This is an anthem for the homesick, for the beaten,
the lost, the broke, the defeated
A song for the heartsick, the standbys,
living life in the shadow of a goodbye

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when we learned how to fly?
We'd play make-believe; we were young and had time on our side.
You're stuck on the ground,
Got lost, can't be found
Just remember that you're still alive

[Chorus]
I'll carry you home
No, you're not alone
Keep marching on,
This is worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
You've had enough,
But just don't give up
Stick to your guns,
You are worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
Keep marching on

[Verse 3]
This is a call to the soldiers, the fighters,
the young, the innocent, and righteous
We've got little room to grow
Better days are near
Hope is so much stronger than fear

[Verse 4]
So if you jump kid don't be scared to fall
We'll be kings and queens in this dream
All for one, one for all
You can light up the dark
There's a fire in your heart,
Burning brighter than ever before

I'll carry you home
No, you're not alone
Keep marching on,
This is worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
You've had enough,
But just don't give up
Stick to your guns,
You are worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
Keep marching on

[Bridge]
On and on like we're living on a broken record
Hope is strong, but misery's a little quicker
Sit and we wait, and we drown there
Thinking why bother play when it's unfair
They say life's a waste, I say they lack belief
They tell me luck will travel; I tell 'em that why I got feet
Left, right, left, right
Moving along to the pulse of a heartbeat
This could be the last chance you have to fly
Do you like the ground?
Want it to pass you by?
You had it all when you were just a kid
Do you even remember who you were back then?
What do you want in life?
Will you be twice as strong?
What would you sacrifice?
What are you waiting on?
Don't stop, march on

[Chorus]
I'll carry you home
No, you're not alone
Keep marching on,
This is worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
You've had enough,
But just don't give up

I am not afraid
Because I know I'm not alone

And if the wind blows north, would you stay your course
And if the wind blows west, would you second guess
And if it blows to the south, would you count me out

And if the sky turns grey, would you walk away
Would you say I do, if I say I'll be

They would boo that, they'd abuse that

In how well I live, if my life's okay
Do I get a car? Hope it's not too nice
Tell me everything you're comfortable with and I'll comply
Can I pay rent? Sure, but not much else
Can I try new sounds? Go fuck yourself
Tell me what I get, tell me what I earn
Tell me all the things you want and I will give up me for you

When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then

Hadn't correctly got my head screwed on
Tried to find a way to write a note
Couldn't get your shower to work

So that I could pull the hood up on my coat
I'm always happy to be leaving
Could be the company I'm keeping

Riflin' through your pockets
And you find them on your face

Sooner or later
This strange little arrangement
And all of its exchanges

Shouldn't have come back
Shouldn't have switched it on at all
Didn't mean to hold you so close
But you know how it goes

I kind of wish that it was New Year's Day
On a vacant street
I cast a long-eyed shadow

Walking around in a daze

I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewellery dripping
Drink and I get all fired up (Hey, hey, hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My mama always said, ""Girl, you're trouble"" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me

We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening

I came here looking for another excuse
To run away from something beautiful
It's like it’s driving me closer to you
Every step back pulls me right back to you

What we feel started way before we ever touched
Just imagine only us
Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, ""It’s no surprise we ain't strangers""
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain't strangers

I'm gonna see some friends
From outta state
The very trip that's you
Were supposed to take a while ago
But it fell through
Like all of you, like all of you

But a free plane ride
Is in the air
Just like that my fear of it disappeared

I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

"Vader","[Verse 1]
From the sacred cathedrals raised on the rock
Born in hate and greed and adoration
Legions sent by wrath of the tyrant
Seed of dead Nazarene, plague of fear and pain
Consecrate me!

[Chorus]
I will kill this world for You
And spill the blood for glory
Hear me God, remit my sins
Rise my throne up to You

[Verse 2]
Call the winds from the pits of burning Hell
Infernal breath of Death
Now break the spell and curse Your foe
No God above myself

[Solo]

[Bridge]
The gates to Hell are open wide again
All monsters released now
Hungry for the blood
The seal is broken, dark Travellers arise
Spinning whirls are swallowing
Every living being
Rain of golden crosses, cold, inverted
Falls with darkness upon the human grave
No breath, no hope, just humiliation
Freezing embrace, exploding holy skulls of the dead

[Solo 2]

Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me?

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

[Verse 2]
As the smoke clears
I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken, but I'm standing on my feet

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground

Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear
Yeah, oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here

Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side

I don't know what you hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)

Verse 1: Jas Mace
I started as the smallest seed
With nothing but darkness all around me (all around)
The air was so tight I couldn't breathe
I thought to myself one day I'm gonna leave (get out of this place)
Just stay positive one day I'm going to blossom (uh)
And stand tall won't a damn thing stop me (nah)
And get the hell up out this dirt
Cause man I got plans to see the light for what it's worth
Just keep pushing I got to have patience (uh)
I can't help it cause waiting is in my nature
But really I can't wait to bear fruit
Giving back to support life (support life)
And be grounded with strong roots (uh)
Cause soon, I gotta branch out and spread my arms wide (wide)
And feel the breeze as it maneuvers through the sky (through the sky)
Cause once I can see best believe I'll be reaching for the sun (as what)
As one of the tallest trees (uh)

Verse 2: Nassim
I get high on raising life
Nothing can bring me to the ground
So take me to another place
I will shine another day

I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Verse 2]
This inconsistency, what does it mean?
You got me questioning, the way you act and take it back
Do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly
